  Local developer override for .runsettings
  
  To use this for local debugging with visible browser:
  1. Copy this file to .runsettings.user (without .example)
  2. The .runsettings.user file is gitignored and will override .runsettings
  3. Set Headless to false to see the browser during test execution
  
  Visual Studio and dotnet test automatically use .runsettings.user if present.
